> A major update in development — featuring a more modern UI, search functionality, color themes, multi-language switching, and more!

This is a desktop-level save management tool specifically designed for the game "Escape The Backrooms", built using Vue.js + JavaScript + CSS for the frontend, and Vite as the build tool. Version 3.0 represents a complete upgrade, offering an entirely new user experience and enhanced functionalities.

This project uses assets extracted from Escape The Backrooms, which are stored in the `icons/ETB_UI` folder within the `public`directory. The names of the resources have not been modified.

There is currently a trial version available, with the version number `V3.0.0-Alpha-6.1`.

If you encounter any bugs while using the trial version, please provide a detailed description of the issue to the developer, or take a screenshot of the error messages shown in the DevTools, and submit an issue.

Due to the high development complexity and intricate logic involved, the `"Hierarchy Information Editing"` feature will be postponed to a future version. Originally, this feature was planned to be introduced in the `"Create New Archive"` and `"Edit Archive"` interfaces
