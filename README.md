> A major update in development — featuring a more modern UI, search functionality, color themes, multi-language switching, and more!

This is a desktop-level save management tool specifically designed for the game "Escape The Backrooms", built using Vue.js + JavaScript + CSS for the frontend, and Vite as the build tool. Version 3.0 represents a complete upgrade, offering an entirely new user experience and enhanced functionalities.

Please note: Future development may include features such as encryption keys. For data security, this part of the code will not be open-sourced, and I will make corresponding annotations for these sections.
